# How to use!

1. Put your assembly file into the inputs folder
2. Compile asm.cpp. Ctrl+Shift+B to use VS Code build preferences, which will leave the executable in build folder
3. Run 
` ./build/asm t1
Note: Currently you need to run this from the top-level directory rvem, otherwise the program can't find your input file.
4. Machine code will output as a .txt file of the same name in the inputs folder
